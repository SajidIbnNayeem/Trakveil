**The concept behind Trakveil is simple yet effective.
Instead of harvesting credentials through phishing pages, it demonstrates how a fake website can trick users into granting location access much like legitimate location based services.
Trakveil Hosts a fake website which asks for Location Permission and if the target allows it, we can get :**

* Longitude
* Latitude
* Accuracy
* Altitude - Not always available
* Direction - Only available if user is moving
* Speed - Only available if user is moving

Along with Location Information we also get **Device Information** without any permissions :

* Unique ID using Canvas Fingerprinting
* Device Model - Not always available
* Operating System
* Platform
* Number of CPU Cores - Approximate Results
* Amount of RAM - Approximate Results
* Screen Resolution
* GPU information
* Browser Name and Version
* Public IP Address
* Local IP Address
* Local Port

**Automatic IP Address Reconnaissance** is performed after the above information is received.

**This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, Trakveil shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.**
